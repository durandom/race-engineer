# AI-Assisted Coding Guidelines

This project encourages the use of AI-assisted coding to improve productivity, code quality, and maintainability. The following guidelines should be observed when using AI tools in this repository:

## Editor Preference

- The preferred editor for this project is [RooCode](https://roocode.com/), which provides a robust environment for AI-assisted coding.
- Avoid "vibe coding" approaches; focus on producing correct, maintainable, and well-tested implementations.

## AI Tooling

- Usage of [llmstxthub.com](https://llmstxthub.com/) is recommended for code generation, refactoring, and documentation tasks.
- When using AI-generated code, always review and test the output for correctness and adherence to project requirements.

## Best Practices

- Prioritize clarity, correctness, and maintainability in all code contributions.
- Ensure that all AI-generated code is covered by unit tests, especially for critical business logic and file interactions.
- Document any significant AI-assisted workflows or decisions in commit messages or project documentation.

By following these guidelines, contributors can leverage AI tools effectively while maintaining high standards for code quality and project integrity.
