# Desktop App Developer (Rust/Tauri + SvelteKit) for Richard Burns Rally Data Viewer

## Project Overview

We are seeking a skilled developer to build a desktop application for viewing Richard Burns Rally (RBR) game data (cars and tracks). The app will read JSON files directly from the RBR installation directory and present the data in a user-friendly interface. The project uses Tauri (Rust backend), SvelteKit (frontend), and Skeleton (UI framework), with TypeScript bindings generated via ts-rs.

## Responsibilities

- Develop a desktop app using Tauri (Rust) and SvelteKit.
- Implement a UI with left-side navigation (cars, tracks, settings) and a main content area.
- Read and display car and track data from RBR JSON files (no local database).
- Ensure all business logic and file access is handled in the Rust backend.
- Write unit tests for both Rust and Svelte components.
- Follow project structure inspired by [mountain-loop/yaak](https://github.com/mountain-loop/yaak).

## Required Skills

- Rust (with Tauri)
- SvelteKit
- TypeScript
- Unit testing (Rust and Svelte)
- Desktop application development

## Deliverables

- Complete source code for the application
- Basic setup instructions (README)
- All unit tests included and passing

## Nice-to-Have

- Experience with Skeleton UI framework
- Familiarity with Richard Burns Rally or similar racing games
